# Object Detection App using YOLO and Streamlit

This application provides an intuitive web interface for real-time object detection in images. Built with Streamlit, it leverages the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for accurate and fast detections, with OpenCV handling image processing and visualizations.

## Features

-   **Interactive Web UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload images and view results.
-   **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes a pretrained YOLO model to identify multiple objects in an image quickly and accurately.
-   **Adjustable Confidence Threshold**: Users can fine-tune the detection sensitivity by adjusting the confidence threshold through a sidebar slider.
-   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Displays the original uploaded image and the processed image with bounding boxes side-by-side for easy comparison.
-   **Detailed Detection Summary**: Provides a comprehensive summary of detected objects, including class names, confidence scores, and total counts.
-   **Downloadable Results**: Allows users to download the processed image with detection overlays for offline use.

## Technologies Used

-   **Backend**: Python
-   **Web Framework**: Streamlit
-   **Object Detection**: YOLO (You Only Look Once)
-   **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow (PIL)
-   **Data Handling**: NumPy
